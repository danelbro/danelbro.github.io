        <h3>Agency as the Grounds for Moral Standing</h3>
        <p>My thesis asks whether we have direct obligations to non-human
        animals—that is, whether they have <em>moral standing</em>—and if so, what
        are the grounds of their moral standing? I argue for three main claims:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Although many influential accounts of the moral standing of animals
   appeal to the capacity for <em>sentience</em> as their grounds, this appeal cannot
   do the explanatory work required of it.</li>
          <li>Animals, both human and non-human, have the capacity for <em>volitional
   agency:</em> we have control over what we do, and therefore can (and must) make
            choices by acting on our desires.</li>
          <li>There is good reason to think that volitional agency is the grounds of
            the moral standing of human and non-human animals</li>
        </ol>

          <h3>Indirect Accounts of Moral Standing</h3>
          <p>This project is an extension of a chapter of my thesis. According to an
           influential account of animal moral standing, animals have moral standing
           because they are sentient, sentient beings have interests, and interests,
           according to this account, matter intrinsically. Because animals have
           interests that matter intrinsically, they conclude, we have obligations to
           them not to frustrate their interests. I argue that the concept of an
           interest that matters intrinsically is untenable, and so these ‘indirect’
           accounts cannot meet their explanatory burdens without begging the
           question. I show that an identical argument applies not only to accounts
           based on sentience, but to any account which employs the concept of
           intrinsically significant interests. Therefore, I argue, we should look
           for a ‘direct’ account of moral standing: an account which starts by
           explaining why <em>individuals</em> of certain kinds matter, and explains
           why we should not frustrate their interests as a consequence of that fact.

          <h3>Refraining and Deciding to Refrain</h3>
          <p>I argue, against the prevailing view of the nature of refraining, that
          it is possible to refrain without deciding to do so. I argue that the
          prevailing ‘decision’ view fails to account for many ordinary not-doings. I
          defend an account of the nature of refraining according to which refraining
          is not doing something one has the ability to do, and argue that my account
          solves the problem with the ‘decision’ view.</p>

          <h3>The Principle of Equal Consideration of Interests</h3>
          <p>Shelly Kagan has recently defended the view that our obligations to
          persons are stronger than our obligations to non-human animals. However,
          philosophers like Peter Singer reject Kagan’s view on the basis that the
          interests of any two individuals should be given equal consideration,
          regardless of e.g. gender, race, or species. But our obligations to, say,
          friends seems stronger than our obligations to strangers. I ask whether
          there is a salient difference between one’s species membership on the one
          hand, and one’s relationships on the other, that explains why preferential
          treatment is impermissible in the former case but permissible in the
          latter. I argue that there is a difference: like one’s race and gender, but
          unlike one’s relationships, one’s species membership is intrinsic to
          one.</p>

          <h3>'Harmlessly' wronging other animals</h3>
          <p>It seems that we can wrong a person without harming them. For example,
          if we treat someone disrespectfully behind their back, then it is plausible
          that we wrong them but it is unclear where the harm to them would be.
          Cheryl Abbate has recently argued that we can likewise ‘harmlessly wrong’
          animals. But the wrongness of being treated disrespectfully, even behind
          one’s back, seemingly depends on understanding that treatment as
          disrespectful, and animals cannot understand that. How could such treatment
          wrong them? Is there any other basis for the claim that animals deserve
          respectful treatment?</p>
