        <p>Do non-human animals have moral standing? Work on this question has
          focused on choosing the right grounding property (for example, personhood
          or sentience) while little attention has been paid to the various ways that
          the connection between grounding properties and moral standing has been
          explained. In this paper, I address that gap by offering a fresh way to
          approach the debate over the grounds of moral standing, including a novel
          taxonomy of positions, and argue that one kind of position, which takes a
          ‘value-first’ approach, is preferable to the other, which takes an
          ‘interests-first’ approach. According to value-first accounts, some
          individuals have moral standing because they have properties that make them
          valuable. According to interests-first accounts, some individuals have
          moral standing because they have interests, and any interest must always be
          taken into account. I argue that we should prefer value-first accounts
          because they engage directly with the problem the concept of moral standing
          is employed to solve, and because interests-first accounts cannot meet
          their explanatory burdens without begging the question against value-first
          accounts.</p>

          target="_blank">Agency as the Grounds for Moral Standing</a></h3>
          <p>My thesis asked whether we have direct obligations to non-human
            animals—that is, whether they have <em>moral standing</em>—and if so,
            what are the grounds of their moral standing? I argue for three main
            claims:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Although many influential accounts of the moral standing of animals
              appeal to the capacity for <em>sentience</em> as their grounds, this
              appeal cannot do the explanatory work required of it.</li>
            <li>Animals, both human and non-human, have the capacity
                for <em>volitional agency:</em> we have control over what we do, and
                therefore can (and must) make choices by acting on our desires.</li>
            <li>There is good reason to think that volitional agency is the grounds
              of the moral standing of human and non-human animals</li>

        <h3>Sentience, value and animal rights</h3>
        <p>Does sentience—the capacity for pleasurable and painful subjective
        experiences—ground animal rights? Several influential accounts, including Tom
        Regan’s influential account of sentient animals as ‘subjects-of-a-life’ (The
        Case for Animal Rights, 1985) and the accounts of contemporary animal rights
        theory (e.g. Sue Donaldson and Will Kymlicka, Zoopolis, 2011), argue that it
        can. In this paper, I examine how these accounts attempt to establish the
        claim. Successfully establishing this claim relies on explaining why
        sentience makes a creature appropriately valuable to be a subject of rights.
        I show, firstly, that Regan’s account is not primarily engaged in this task:
        Regan argues that subjects-of-a-life are ‘inherently valuable’ but, to avoid
        arguing an ‘ought’ from an ‘is’, does not attempt to explain why. Secondly, I
        show that animal rights theorists have developed Regan’s account by appealing
        to the value of sentience; but while they establish a plausible necessary
        condition on rights, their account cannot do the work they require. I
        conclude that friends of animal rights theory ought to give up on appealing
        to the value of sentience and ought instead to appeal to the value of the
        kind of agential capacity we share with animals.</p>

        <h3>Animals as volitional agents</h3>
        <p>Agency is, in general, the exercise of powers and abilities to bring about
        events. If different kinds of beings cause events in distinctive ways, by
        exercising distinctive sets of capacities and abilities, they can be said to
        have different <em>forms</em> of agency. Is there a form of agency which is
        distinctive of <em>animals</em>—both human and non-human? While the rational
        capacities of human agents seem to make <em>human</em> agency distinctive in
        many ways, since (at most) very few species of non-human animals share these
        capacities this set of capacities cannot be what is distinctive about animal
        agency. But I argue that there is at least one feature of human agency which
        distinguishes it from the agency of inanimate beings and plants
        but <em>not</em> from the agency of non-human anmimals: that we sometimes
        have <em>control</em> over whether we exercise our abilities: the exercise of
        our abilities is ‘up to us’; or as it is sometimes put, we are sometimes able
        to ‘act otherwise’.</p>

        <h3>Refraining and Deciding to Refrain</h3>
        <p>I argue, against the prevailing view of the nature of refraining, that it
          is possible to refrain without deciding to do so. I argue that the
          prevailing ‘decision’ view fails to account for many ordinary not-doings. I
          defend an account of the nature of refraining according to which refraining
          is not doing something one has the ability to do, and argue that my account
          solves the problem with the ‘decision’ view.</p>
