          <h3>Agency as the Grounds for Moral Standing</h3>
          <p>My thesis asks whether we have direct obligations to non-human
            animals—that is, whether they have <em>moral standing</em>—and if so, what
            are the grounds of their moral standing? I argue for three main claims:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Although many influential accounts of the moral standing of animals
              appeal to the capacity for <em>sentience</em> as their grounds, this appeal cannot
              do the explanatory work required of it.</li>
            <li>Animals, both human and non-human, have the capacity for <em>volitional
                agency:</em> we have control over what we do, and therefore can (and must) make
              choices by acting on our desires.</li>
            <li>There is good reason to think that volitional agency is the grounds of
              the moral standing of human and non-human animals</li>
          </ol>

        <h3>[Title removed for blind review]</h3>
        <p>I show that an influential argument for the moral standing of sentient animals relies on an untenable explanatory structure.</p>

        <h3>Refraining and Deciding to Refrain</h3>
        <p>I argue, against the prevailing view of the nature of refraining, that it
          is possible to refrain without deciding to do so. I argue that the
          prevailing ‘decision’ view fails to account for many ordinary not-doings. I
          defend an account of the nature of refraining according to which refraining
          is not doing something one has the ability to do, and argue that my account
          solves the problem with the ‘decision’ view.</p>

        <h3>The Principle of Equal Consideration of Interests</h3>
        <p>Shelly Kagan has recently defended the view that our obligations to
          persons are stronger than our obligations to non-human animals. However,
          philosophers like Peter Singer reject Kagan’s view on the basis that the
          interests of any two individuals should be given equal consideration,
          regardless of e.g. gender, race, or species. But our obligations to, say,
          friends seems stronger than our obligations to strangers. I ask whether
          there is a salient difference between one’s species membership on the one
          hand, and one’s relationships on the other, that explains why preferential
          treatment is impermissible in the former case but permissible in the
          latter. I argue that there is a difference: like one’s race and gender, but
          unlike one’s relationships, one’s species membership is intrinsic to
          one.</p>

        <h3>'Harmlessly' wronging other animals</h3>
        <p>It seems that we can wrong a person without harming them. For example,
          if we treat someone disrespectfully behind their back, then it is plausible
          that we wrong them but it is unclear where the harm to them would be.
          Cheryl Abbate has recently argued that we can likewise ‘harmlessly wrong’
          animals. But the wrongness of being treated disrespectfully, even behind
          one’s back, seemingly depends on understanding that treatment as
          disrespectful, and animals cannot understand that. How could such treatment
          wrong them? Is there any other basis for the claim that animals deserve
          respectful treatment?</p>
