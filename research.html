        <h2>PhD Project</h2>
        <h3>Agency as the Grounds for Moral Standing</h3>
        <p>My thesis asks whether we have direct obligations to non-human
        animals—that is, whether they have <em>moral standing</em>—and if so, what
        are the grounds of their moral standing? I argue for three main claims:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Although many influential accounts of the moral standing of animals
   appeal to the capacity for <em>sentience</em> as their grounds, this appeal cannot
   do the explanatory work required of it.</li>
          <li>Animals, both human and non-human, have the capacity for <em>volitional
   agency:</em> we have control over what we do, and therefore can (and must) make
   choices by acting on our desires.</li>
          <li>There is good reason to think that volitional agency is the grounds of
            the moral standing of human and non-human animals</li>
        </ol>

          <h3>Indirect Accounts of Moral Standing</h3>
          <p>This project is an extension of a chapter of my thesis. According to a
          range of influential accounts, animals have moral standing because they
          have a property, for example sentience or the capacity for intentional
          agency, which guarantees the presence of interests that matter
          intrinsically. Because animals have such interests, they conclude, we have
          obligations to them not to frustrate their interests. I argue that the
          concept of an interest that matters intrinsically is problematic, and so
          these accounts cannot meet their explanatory burdens without begging the
          question. Instead, we should pursue ‘direct’ accounts of moral standing:
          accounts which start by explaining why individuals of certain kinds matter,
          and which explain why we should not frustrate their interests as a
          consequence of that fact.

          <h3>Refraining and Deciding to Refrain</h3>
          <p>I argue against a prevailing view on which refraining from doing
          something requires deciding to refrain from doing so, on the grounds that
          this view fails to account for many ordinary instances of refraining. I
          defend an alternative account, according to which refraining is not-doing
          something that one has the ability to do, and show that my account is
          preferable to the ‘decision’ view because, unlike the ‘decision’ view, it
          can accommodate those ordinary cases of refraining.</p>

          <h3>On the Principle of Equal Consideration of Interests</h3>
          <p>Shelly Kagan (‘What’s Wrong with Speciesism?’ <i>Journal of Applied
          Philosophy</i> 2016; <i>How to Count Animals, More or Less</i>, OUP 2019)
          has recently defended the view that our obligations to persons are stronger
          than our obligations to non-persons. Peter Singer (‘Why Speciesism Is
          Wrong: A Response to Kagan’, <i>Journal of Applied Philosophy</i> 2016)
          rejects Kagan’s view on the basis that the interests of any two individuals
          should be given equal consideration, regardless of e.g. gender, race, or
          personhood status. However, it seems that Singer’s view does not have room
          for the thought that our obligations to, say, friends seems stronger than
          our obligations to strangers. I ask whether there is any salient difference
          between personhood status on the one hand, and relationships on the other,
          that explains why preferential treatment is impermissible in the former
          case but permissible in the latter. I argue that there is a difference:
          like one’s race and gender, but unlike one’s relationships, one’s
          personhood status is intrinsic to one.</p>

          <h3>Can other animals be ‘harmlessly wronged’?</h3>
          <p>It seems that we can wrong a person without harming them. For example,
          if we treat someone disrespectfully behind their back, then it is plausible
          that we wrong them but it is unclear that we cause them any harm. Cheryl
          Abbate (‘Valuing Animals As They Are: Whether They Feel It Or Not’,
          <i>European Journal of Philosophy</i> 2020) has recently argued that we can
          ‘harmlessly wrong’ animals too. However, the wrongness of being treated
          disrespectfully, even behind one’s back, seemingly depends on one’s
          capacity to understand that treatment as disrespectful, and animals cannot
          understand that. I examine whether there is any other basis for the claim
          that animals deserve respectful treatment that could underpin Abbate’s
          claim.</p>
